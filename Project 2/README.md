This project, conducted in collaboration with Dr. George Papandonatos (Biostatistics Department), examines smoking cessation among adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Individuals with MDD are more likely to smoke heavily, display stronger nicotine dependence, and experience more severe withdrawal symptoms. While varenicline aids in smoking cessation, addressing depression-related factors may further improve treatment outcomes.

To better understand these dynamics, three modeling techniques—Lasso, Ridge, and standard Logistic Regression—were applied to identify key predictors of cessation success. Figure 5, which compares the ROC curves and AUC metrics among these models, shows that Lasso and Ridge provide streamlined sets of influential predictors, while Logistic Regression offers a more traditional, interpretable framework. Together, these results highlight the complex, multifaceted nature of smoking cessation in MDD populations.

Notably, the Lasso model revealed that the nicotine metabolism ratio and the distinction between current and past MDD symptoms are critical predictors. Individuals with higher nicotine metabolism rates may require tailored treatment strategies, while ongoing depressive symptoms appear to uniquely affect quitting efforts. These findings point toward more personalized, effective intervention protocols, ultimately improving the likelihood of cessation success for individuals with MDD.
