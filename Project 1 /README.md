The current study aims to investigate the effects of age, gender, and environmental factors on marathon performance. By analyzing data from major marathons, we hope to understand how these variables influence runners' race times and identify the most significant weather parameters affecting performance across different age groups and genders.

The analysis of marathon performance across age and gender reveals several key findings. Both age and gender play significant roles in determining how close runners come to achieving record times, with younger runners and females generally performing closer to record levels compared to older males. Environmental factors such as humidity and solar radiation also have statistically significant impacts on marathon performance, suggesting that runners in more humid or sunny conditions may require additional support to optimize their results.

The multiple linear regression model identifies red flag conditions, dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation as the most influential weather parameters affecting marathon times. High temperatures and humidity appear to be the main contributors to slower performance, as they hinder the body's ability to dissipate heat effectively. Interestingly, the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which incorporates multiple environmental factors, was not found to be significant in the model, indicating that the multiple linear regression approach may not be the most appropriate method for this particular analysis.
